== Intro

`srtool` is a collection of dockerized tools helping with https://substrate.io[Substrate] & https://polkadot.network[Polkadot] Runtime development. `srtool` especially allows building WASM runtimes in a deterministic way, allowing CIs and users, with various machines and OS, to produce a strictly identical WASM runtime.

`srtool` can run on various Operating Systems supporting Docker. That includes Linux, MacOS and Windows.

`srtool` especially helps with building and verifying WASM Runtimes. The Docker image is named `{name}`. You can find the project's repository at https://hub.docker.com/r/{name}.

== Docker image naming scheme

The Docker images are tagged with both the rustc version used internally as well as the version of the build script.

You will find for instance the following:

- `{name}:{rsversion}-0.9.16`
- `{name}:{rsversion}-{version}`
- `{name}:{rsversion}`

The tags not mentioning the build version always point to the latest one. In the example above, `{name}:{rsversion}` is the same image than `{name}:{rsversion}-{version}`.

== Related tools

There are a few other helpers you may want to check out when using `srtool`:

- https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli[srtool-cli]: This Rust executable supersedes the preiviously recommended alias solution. It brings many benefits and is moreover much easier to use.
- https://gitlab.com/chevdor/srtool-app[srtool-app]: The basic features of `srtool` as here available from a simple GUI accessible from a few clicks and available on multiple platforms.
- https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-actions[srtool-actions]: This Github actions makes it much easier to integrate `srtool` in your CI.
- ... and more to come

`srtool` is a tool for chain builders, it is widely used in CI such as Github Actions, it can also be used by anyone who wants to indenpendantly check and audit the runtime of a chain or a parachain.

You may also want to have a look at https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm[subwasm] as it is now part of the tooling included in `srtool`. `subwasm` can also be used independantly upon building your wasm with `srtool`.

== History

The project was initially developped from https://gitlab.com/chevdor.
It now moved to Github under the https://www.github.com/paritytech[Parity Technologies] organisation to simplify the developement and the integration with other Parity products such as Polkadot and Kusama.

The last version hosted on Gitlab has been built using Rust Stable {rsversion}. It is tagged as v{version} and there is no plan on updating the Gitlab repository further. New versions will be available from https://www.github.com/paritytech/srtool. The functionnalities remain the same so you can (and should!) simply swap `chevdor/srtool` for `paritytech/srtool` in your workflows. The https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-actions[srtool-actions] will remain available as `chevdor/srtool-actions@<version>` and will be updated to point at the paritytech image.

== Install

=== Install the srtool-cli

Since the `srtool-cli` (https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli) exists, there is no reason to be using an alias anymore. Using the cli over the alias brings many advantages and will save you time.

The `srtool-cli` is a command line utility written in Rust, you can read more at https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli[github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli], the installation process is described in more details there.

=== Using an alias

IMPORTANT: This method is legacy and deprecated, prefer the `srtool-cli` utility mentioned above. This information is left here however for documentation purpose but all the functions are now availabe in the `srtool-cli`.

Creating an alias helps hiding the docker complexity behind one simple command. We will see more powerful options but this one is simple enough.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    export RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion}; export PACKAGE=kusama-runtime; alias srtool='docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$PACKAGE -v $PWD:/build -v $TMPDIR/cargo:/cargo-home {name}:$RUSTC_VERSION'
----

NOTE: Note that defining the alias as done above will hardcode the runtime. Using `kusama-runtime` as show above means you will *always* check the kusama runtime. If you need more, check the next chapter.

NOTE: If you want to check what your alias is, use `type srtool`

The command to invoke a build will then be `srtool build`.

== Use

Now that you defined the srtool alias, you can use it as shown below:

.See the help
    $ srtool help

.Build the runtime
    $ srtool build

.Typical run

Invoking `srtool build` with:

    $ srtool build

will output something that looks like this:

    ‚è≥ That can take a little while, be patient... subsequent builds will be faster.
    Since you have to wait a little, you may want to learn more about Substrate runtimes:

.JSON output
If you prefer a json output, srtool has you covered:

    $ srtool build --json

Will give you such an output:

== Troubleshooting

=== Outdated repo

If you run into issues while running `srtool`, make sure you are using a decently recent version of Polkadot/Substrate:

Then run the following commands:

    rm -rf target/srtool
    cargo clean
    cargo update

You can now try running `srtool build` again.

=== `srtool` tells me the folder is not a cargo project

The error is probably: `!!! The folder on your host computer does not look like a Cargo project. Are you really in your repo?``

Run the following command:

    alias srtool

And make sure that you see `$PWD:/build/` and not `/home/your_name/:/build`.
If you are running into this issue, your `.bash_profile` likely contains double quotes (") where you should have used single ones (').

=== Other cases

If you still run into troubles, please open a new issue and describe the error you see and the steps you took.

== Proposal field

What is important in the output of srtool is the `Proposal` field:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    üß∞ Substrate Runtime Toolbox üß∞
    ... Bla bla ...
    Proposal : 0x5931690e71e9d3d9f04a43d8c15e45e0968e563858dd87ad6485b2368a286a8f
    ... more blabla ...
----

The `Proposal` field value should should match the value of the proposal you can see in the Polkadot UI.

== IPFS Hash

Starting with version 0.9.8, the IPFS hash is computed and added to the output. `srtool` is only computing the hash. It does not publish the the file to IPFS nor connect to IPFS.

.Advanced usage
if you feel fancy, you may also run:

    srtool bash

and look around the `/srtool` folder

include::doc/zsh.adoc[]

include::doc/build.adoc[]

== User Scripts

You can see the list of available scripts in the `/scripts` folder:

- `help`: Show some help
- `version`: Show some version.
- `info`: Show systems infos that are available before running a build
- `build`: Run the actual build

NOTE: The `info` and `version` scripts pass any arguments you pass to the script to `jq`. So you can play with `c` (compact), `-M`(monochrome), `-C` color output. For instance `docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/build chevdor/srtool:{rsversion} info -cM` shows a monochrome output on a single line.

== Build your custom chain / parachain

Building the runtime for your custom chain may not work with the default used for Kusama, Polkadot and Co.
You can however help `srtool` making the right choices using ENV VARs. You will need to make a new alias as shown below

Here is for instance how to build the runtime for the substrate-node-template:

    alias mysrtool='docker run --rm -it --name mysrtool -e RUNTIME_DIR=runtime -e BUILD_OPTS=" " -e PACKAGE=$PACKAGE -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home chevdor/srtool:$RUSTC_VERSION'

NOTE: `BUILD_OPTS` is set to a space, not an empty string.

NOTE: Using `srtool-cli` makes the above much easier...

== Export the runtime

In order to easily export your runtime, it will be copied in the container into the `/out` folder.
If you mount this docker volume, you will find the wasm on your local filesystem once the run is complete.

    docker run ... -v /tmp/out:/out ...
