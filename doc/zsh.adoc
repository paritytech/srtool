== ZSH/ Zinit users

If you're using `zsh` and `zinit`, you may benefit from using the srtool snippet maintained https://gitlab.com/chevdor/dotfiles/-/tree/master/zsh-plugins[here].

To do so, add the following to your `zshconfig`:

```
MY_REPO="https://gitlab.com/chevdor/dotfiles/-/raw/master/zsh-plugins"
for plugin (git cargo srtool); {<1>
  SNIPPET="$MY_REPO/$plugin/$plugin.plugin.zsh"
  zinit snippet $SNIPPET
}
```
<1> Chose the snippets you want, the one called `srtool` here is the interesting one.

After that, make sure to:
- upgrade your snippets: `zplugin update --all`
- restart/source your shell: `. ~/.zshrc`
